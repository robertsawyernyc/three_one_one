The 311 project takes a look at NYC 311 Service Requests and analyzes them in order to answer the following:

1. What types of services are being requested? 
2. Which service requests are most frequent?
3. How do service requests compare from one location to the next?
4. What types of locations receive the most complaints?
5. Which city agencies are called upon to service requests?
6. Which city agencies are most efficient in completing requests?
7. Drawing on the anaylsis and identifying trends, what recommendations can be made to better utilize city resources?
